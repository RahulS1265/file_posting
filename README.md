# file_posting
### A third-level heading

this is just a small project thet uploads the file that is been selected by the user and generates a link for the file basically like a google drive ,but in that method user has to use the google drive compared to that this is little convinient.

>the user file is uploaded to the [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) a free web container 

 since this is a small project i waanted to learn HTML,CSS and the use of flask in an separate environment 
 this is not hosted u can use it on a developer server or u can host it too...
